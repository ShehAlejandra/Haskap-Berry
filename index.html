							<h2><a href="#">Spring Harvest</a></h2>
							<img src="images/HaskapTree.jpg" alt="Haskap Berries, Spring harvest, Fruit Trees">
							<p> Haskaps are an exceptional plant for your garden for a number of different reasons. If you live somewhere that hits those negative degrees, this tree/ bush is for you! Haskaps are incredibly winter durable. These bushes are commonly found in cooler temperate areas of Canada, Poland, Russia and Japan. The shrub or tree generally grows between 4-6 feet and takes about 4 feet wide. The plant flowers in early may lining up with the canadian springs and is ready to produce fruit and harvest in late June or early July. When these shrubs do produce fruit, you must keep your eyes out for birds! Birds love this fruit and will stalk the tree for when it produces fruit.</p>


								<p>These bushes are also considered fast growing. They are high yielding shrubs that produce the earliest crops of all of the berry plants. A single mature plant is known to produce up to 7-10lb of fruit! Another quality of the haskap plant is that it is disease and pest resistant, which makes it a lot easier to grow naturally. Haskap plants are not very fussy when growing. They require full to part shaded sun light. Haskaps can grow in most soil as long as it dries between waters.
