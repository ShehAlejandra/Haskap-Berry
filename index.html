							<h2><a href="#">Spring Harvest</a></h2>
							<img src="images/HaskapTree.jpg" alt="Haskap Berries, Spring harvest, Fruit Trees">
							<p> These unique berries grow on trees that stand about 4-6 feet tall and approximately 4 feet wide. The plant tends to flower in early May with the fruit ready to harvest in late June or early July. This adaptable plant can endure cold hardy winters, -45C in Saskatchewan, Canada. Haskap has been planted in a number of countries and is found growing wild in every province in Canada except British Columbia. Haskap berries and the plants itself are not self pollinating. You need at least 2 compatible varieties for enough pollination. These two plants must bloom at similar times, it needs to overlap.  
							After the plant gets unproductive and old the tree is chopped down with about half a foot sticking out about the surface and will re-grow. </p>
