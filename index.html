              Haskap berries are very high in vitamin C and A as well
              as fiber and potassium. They have a significant amount
              of antioxidants in them, in fact it is about three times
              more than a blueberry.

              These berries are a hidden gem, you can add them in your

              minerals and antioxidants, they are also very
              complimentary to many other tasty things. Uncommon

              one of his cider offerings to create a unique, or
              ‘uncommon’ like cider. This cider has notes of
              pomegranate, plum, and fruit leather with a stunning

              Haskap berries are one of the secret berries that are
              showing up in canadian farmers markets. It has many
              names from Honeyberries, Edible Honeysuckles, Blue
              Honeysuckles, Sweet Berry or even the Canadian Honey
              Berry.

            <p>
              A Haskap berry has a complex tasting profile.This fruit
              can be described as tasting like a cross between a
              blueberry and as raspberry or long grape, with a kiwi
              like texture. The different varieties of Haskap all
              taste a little different to the next depending one when
              it was picked and how ripe it is.The berry itself has a
              beautiful deep purple and blue like color.

                Farmers Putting it all on Blue Haskap berries are
                gaining ground in Canadian fields as farmers are placing
                their bets on the new superfood. The berry is a relative
                newcomer to store shelves and many consumers are not yet
                familiar with it, even though farmers have been growing
                Haskap berries in Saskatchewan for the last fifteen
                years. Saskatchewan Haskap orchard owner Curtis Braaten,
                speaking to CTVNews Saskatoon, hopes this will change as
                consumers are educated about the benefits of the berry:
                “More and more consumers will be aware of it. And as
                time goes on, every year, there will be more production.
                So check out your local super market. Ask the produce
                manager, do you have any haskaps berries? Educate them
                and it's only a matter of time until we have them out
                every season.” Haskap berries are a versatile super
                food, high in antioxidants and vitamins. They can be
                made into jams and spreads, or incorporated into
                desserts like ice cream, or reduced into syrup. With any
                luck we will soon see Haskap berries appearing on store
                shelves across Canada, coming to the table from farms in
                several provinces including Saskatchewan. Haskap farmer
                Kanden Yungwirth has high hopes for the Haskap berry’s
                future on Canadian store shelves: “I'd love to see it
                being not shipped anywhere, just being consumed all
                locally. We grow it here. I'd like to see everyone
                enjoying it and getting more producers in the game.” You

            <h2>Spring Harvest</h2>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Haskaps are an exceptional plant for your garden for a
                number of different reasons. If you live somewhere that
                hits those negative degrees, this tree/ bush is for you!
                Haskaps are incredibly winter durable. These bushes are
                commonly found in cooler temperate areas of Canada,
                Poland, Russia and Japan. The shrub or tree generally
                grows between 4-6 feet and takes about 4 feet wide. The
                plant flowers in early may lining up with the canadian
                springs and is ready to produce fruit and harvest in
                late June or early July. When these shrubs do produce
                fruit, you must keep your eyes out for birds! Birds love
                this fruit and will stalk the tree for when it produces
                fruit.
              </p>
              <p>
                These bushes are also considered fast growing. They are
                high yielding shrubs that produce the earliest crops of
                all of the berry plants. A single mature plant is known
                to produce up to 7-10lb of fruit! Another quality of the
                haskap plant is that it is disease and pest resistant,
                which makes it a lot easier to grow naturally. Haskap
                plants are not very fussy when growing. They require
                full to part shaded sun light. Haskaps can grow in most
                soil as long as it dries between waters.
